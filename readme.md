## CHESS AI, C++

Hi! This is a pretty simple minimax-based chess game in C++. To prompt the algorithm to run, press the backslash key on Black's turn.
This project uses the wonderful SFML library, which really simplified all of the rendering and game mechanics.

I've provided a makefile for the project, but you will need your own install of SFML for compilation. For more information,
see the SFML docs.
